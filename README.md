This is a RPG Game done following freeCodeCamp's guide and instructions. 

Here I show my knowledge of HTML and CSS but mainly JavaScript, which is a language that I've been learning
and practcing with small projects for a couple of months now. I still have a long way to go on it but I'm also feeling like I'm starting to get the hang of it.
While doing this project, I could learn more about JavaScript's functions, arrays, operators, variables, if...else statements, loops and etc and I was able to practice my existential skills on this language.

I inivite you to watch my learning process on here with JavaScript but sooner expanded to more languages and more complex projects.

I would also like to thank freeCodeCamp's entire team for allowing people like me, ambicious students, to improve our
skills and knowledges with these fun and begginner-friendly projects! You can check them out at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn.

See you soon, hope you have a good day! âœ¨
